# M.Tech---Project
This project deals with the application of ArtiÔ¨Åcial Neural Network (ANN) based Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) approach to Decentralized Automatic generation Control (DAGC) Scheme for Interconnected multi-area Power System.The performance DAGC based ANFIS controller is compared with DAGC Integral controller. Simulations results indicates that DAGC based ANFIS controller exhibits better performance.
